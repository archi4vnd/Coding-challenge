Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going
into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github,
Bitbucket...).


Functional spec
---------------

Prototype the following project:

#### Contact Manager App 

The goal of the test, is to build a contact manager app. It has three screens:

- List contacts. This screen shows a list of profiles by name with a small thumbnail. 
- Add contact. This screen captures data for the profile. Specifically, the image, user name, phone and email address. 
- Contact details. Clicking on an individual contact from the list screen should display this screen. All profile data should be shown - photo, name, email, phone.


Technical spec
--------------

### Backend

- ES6
- SailsJS
- MySQL on AWS RDS
- S3 for the photo


### Frontend

This area is very flexible. The front-end should ideally take a single page app approach. However the tools, libraries, and frameworks you decide to use are entirely up to you. 
You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your expertise in tools like Bootstrap, React, etc. Feel free to mention in your `README` how much experience you have with respect to the technical choices you make. We will take note of that when reviewing your challenge.



We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them.


You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code). If the framework you choose is rather large or niche, please explain in a short paragraph how the framework works, why you chose it, how things are wired together, etc. If possible, please remove any unused boilerplate generated before submitting your project for review.


Host it!
--------

When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).

How will we review?
